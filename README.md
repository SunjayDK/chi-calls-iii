Chi Calls - The Wordpress Edition

## Setting up your local environment

### 1. Install MAMP/LAMP/WAMP
These stacks (which stand for Mac/Linux/Windows Apache MySQL PHP) allow you to run Wordpress locally on your machine.

[MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/downloads/) and [WAMP](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) have downloadable packages that you can install just by downloading and going through the regular install process.

LAMP is [somewhat more complicated](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-linux-apache-mysql-php-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu-16-04), and if you need help with this please reach out.

### 2. Setting up MAMP settings
*This section only works for Macbooks and other Apple computers*
